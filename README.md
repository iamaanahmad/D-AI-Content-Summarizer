# ‚ú® Decentralized AI Content Summarizer

A modern, responsive web application that leverages the Google Gemini API to generate concise summaries of articles and text. Users can input text directly, provide a URL for content fetching, and choose from various summary formats. The application also simulates saving the result to a decentralized storage network like IPFS or Arweave, making it a great portfolio piece for Web3 and AI enthusiasts.
